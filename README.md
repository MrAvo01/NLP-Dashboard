Twitter Scraping NLP Dashboard

The Twitter Sentiment Analysis jupyter notebook file contains a TwitterMain class, which pulls Tweets from Twitter based on a search query, cleans tweets and contains methods to determine bag of words features, NLP based sentiment and some visualisations. This file is pretty straightforwards and contains comments along the way to describe what each element and function is intended to do.
